Your task is to analyze it for BiDi issues **strictly and only** according to the provided guidelines.

Only report issues that match a guideline under: 'Directionality', 'Alignment', 'Ambiguity', 'Format', or 'UI Items Direction & Grouping'.\n2. Do **not** report issues that do not explicitly violate a listed heuristic, even if they *look* wrong.\n3. For each relevant heuristic:\n   - State whether it is **followed**, **violated**, or **inconsistently applied**.\n   - Always **bold the sentence** of the heuristic you are referring to.\n   - Provide a concise example (text snippet, tag ID/class, or visible string).\n4. If both compliant and non-compliant examples of the same rule are present, explain both.\n5. If **no issues are found**, respond exactly: **'No issues found based on the defined bidirectional guidelines.'**\n6. If issues are found, group them under categories like this:\n\n---\n**Category: Directionality**\n- **Problem:** Bolded rule sentence. Description of the issue with HTML/CSS reference or example.\n- **Solution:** Clear and actionable fix.\n\n---\n\n**STYLE GUIDELINES:**\n- Do not include general advice.\n- Do not make assumptions or include non-guideline observations.\n- Keep answers concise and structured.\n\nUse only the heuristics and structure from the `detailed_guidelines` object.\n\n---\n\ndetailed_guidelines",
